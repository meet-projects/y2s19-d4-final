						<h2>About Us</h2>
					</header>
					<p style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold;">Our Story:<br></p>
					<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">We started TravlerPack when we became aware of the millions of people who have been displaced from their homes during the Syrian civil war. One of the greatest challenges they face is the weather. The winter brings plunging temperatures and brutal snowstorms, and many refugees do not have the proper means to stay warm.<br><br>

					In the beginning, we wanted to design a sleeping bag to keep people warm. After speaking with refugees about their living conditions, we decided we needed to rethink the sleeping bag. We built TravlerPack as a disaster resilience tool to address basic needs like secure storage and mobility while providing warmth. In the past two years we sewed our first prototype together in a dorm kitchen and negotiated with manufacturers; we tested our bag by spending the night outside in a snowstorm and spoke to refugees and nonprofits across the world; we developed a product that we believe can keep people warm while improving their quality of life and launched a campaign that raised $52,000; and we sent 600 TravlerPacks to Syria.<br><br>

					Since our first distribution in winter 2017, we have followed up with the recipients of TravlerPacks. The feedback has been positive. We know that TravlerPack is making a difference in these people’s lives and we want to continue this impact for the coming winter.</p>

					<p style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold;">Timeline:<br></p>
